      <h4>Introduction</h4>
      <p>Hi.  I’m Steve Deddens; almost everyone refers to me simply as “Deddens.”  This page, that I built, serves as a vehicle to introduce myself and allow you to get to know more about me.  There are two sections: <a href="#vignettes">“Vignettes”</a> and <a href="#projects">"My Projects”.</a>  If you are looking for a summary of my professional career, please visit my <a class="aLinkedIn" href="js_injection" target='_blank'>LinkedIn page</a>.</p>

      <p>But first... I want to share a couple of human interest images:</p>

      <a href="#" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#modal-future-1"><img src="" width="40" class='img-rounded future-1' alt='Our Future' title="View Image"></a>

      <a href="#" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#modal-future-2"><img src="" width="40" class='img-rounded future-2' alt='Our Future' title="View Image"></a>

      <p>These two images show me interacting with a group of two-year-old boys whom I supervise on Sunday mornings while their parents are attending church services.  They are working a jigsaw puzzle on my handheld device.  What great fun it is working with these children that <em>are our future</em>. Notice the intense focus of attention these boys have! That's what makes these images so great.></p>

      <h4>Vignettes</h4>

      <p>This section contains a series of short essays that are written by me. They are derived from my various life experiences. This is my opportunity to give you, the reader, a view into my persona. The central themes are: working with people, problem solving, and hard work.</p>

      <p>My favorite is “My Vision: PowerBids."  It may be <abbr title="Too Long Didn't Read">TLDR</abbr> but the testimonials alone, at the end, make it well worth the read. I am proud to share these vignettes with you. Some are rather humorous! Please explore all of them!</p>

            <h2 class="c0 c3"><span>Why Things Work</span></h2><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>I have always been fascinated with the way things work. &nbsp;If I weren&rsquo;t building something, then I was taking something apart just to see how it was made. &nbsp;From automobile transmissions to microprocessors, I simply had to know how they functioned. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p>

            <p class="c0"><span>Seems to me most people learn inductively. &nbsp;Not me. &nbsp;No, I have to learn the hard way. &nbsp;I have to &ldquo;take it apart&rdquo;, see inside. &nbsp;I learn deductively. &nbsp;As it turns out, it pays dividends to learn that way. &nbsp;As they say, a picture is worth a thousand words. &nbsp;Once one &ldquo;sees inside&rdquo; a thing, it is easy to comprehend and remember the total scope of a thing&rsquo;s functionality. &nbsp;Through deduction, the permutations become obvious. &nbsp;At that point, an instructor simply provides guidance. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p>

            <p class="c0"><span>A close friend of mine once gave me a huge compliment that went something like this: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re hungry, get out the battering ram, and knock the front door down only to find you inside at the dinner table half done with supper.&rdquo; &nbsp;Understanding how and why things work is my strength. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s my key to the back door.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p>

(a pool of available schedules published monthly for bid)</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>The flying schedules in a bid package are commonly referred to as &ldquo;lines of time.&rdquo; &nbsp;The lines are formatted horizontally as thirty-one day calendars across the page with twelve schedules/lines printed per page; each line has a unique numeric reference and the body of each line contains alphanumeric references to &ldquo;pairings&rdquo;, printed elsewhere. &nbsp;The pairings contain the detailed specifics of each day&rsquo;s flying.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>The bidding process involves analyzing and sorting the lines into a list ordered according to one&rsquo;s preferences; then, typing the list into a computer terminal. &nbsp;After the bid closes, the schedules are awarded in seniority order. &nbsp;The most senior person bidding need only bid one line. &nbsp;The most junior person bidding will get the last line remaining. &nbsp;The bid packages are printed front and back using a monospaced font, can easily exceed 400 lines, and can be over a half inch thick. &nbsp;Deciding which lines to bid, and in what order, quickly becomes a monumental task.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Faced with this difficult and repetitive task, I had devised a manual process to help me bid. &nbsp;First, I used a simple algorithm to calculate a line&rsquo;s productivity (paid time relative to unpaid time spent away from home). &nbsp;Then, I would literally cut out the printed lines and rearrange them in productivity order. &nbsp;In essence, I was reformatting the bid package according to my requirements. </span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>A vision haunted me for years as I toiled away at this process. &nbsp;I imagined building a computer program that would automate what I was doing manually, then submit the bid to the company&rsquo;s mainframe computer. &nbsp;I also imagined enhancing the alphanumeric pairing references on the lines with much more intuitive and informative Gantt diagrams. &nbsp;Problem was, my vision required: a personal computer, programming software, being able to access the company&#39;s files containing the bid package data, and a network connection to the airline&rsquo;s computers. &nbsp;All of which, in the 1970&rsquo;s, and most of the 1980&rsquo;s, did not exist. &nbsp;In addition, I would need to learn computer programming.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>However, things started to change and in </span><span class="c3">1987</span><span>, the airline started posting the files I needed on CompuServe&rsquo;s new dial-up network. &nbsp;Suddenly, my vision was within reach. &nbsp;I purchased an </span><span class="c3">Amiga</span><span>&nbsp;computer, a text editor, and a Modula-2 compiler (programming software). &nbsp;Then, I rolled up my sleeves, taught myself the Modula-2 programming language, and went to work writing a parser to use on the newly available files. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Surprisingly, it took me only a couple of days to write a program that would read the files, calculate all the lines&rsquo; productivity values, and print the bid package in productivity order. &nbsp;Wow! &nbsp;Just like that, I had a valuable tool that automated the sorting I was doing by hand.. &nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t stop there. &nbsp;All the pieces were in place to realize a second part of my vision. &nbsp;In a couple of days of programming I was printing the lines using Gantt diagrams to graphically illustrate the pairings. &nbsp;Except for automatically submitting the bid, my vision was realized. &nbsp;Also, It should be noted that I leaned on Steve Endicott (Endi), one of my college roommates and an accomplished computer programmer, for tutoring and advice. &nbsp;He was the go-to resource whenever I hit the wall trying to solve a problem. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I showed a printout of my work to a copilot. &nbsp;He immediately pulled a hundred dollar bill from his wallet and proclaimed that he was my first client. &nbsp;Client? &nbsp;Up until that moment there was never any thought of marketing my work. Within a few months I had over a hundred new clients handing me entry forms containing their specific bidding parameters, and paying me for a printout. &nbsp;I bought a small database program for the Amiga. &nbsp;Each month I manually transcribed the data from the forms into the database. &nbsp;Then, using my software and the Gantt diagrams, I would print and mail a custom bid package to each client. &nbsp;Consider this as a stepping stone in a long journey as the monetary return was never really enough to justify the labor involved. &nbsp;My bidding problem was solved and I was also able to help my peers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>By </span><span class="c3">1994</span><span>&nbsp;the personal computer was becoming ubiquitous; presenting yet another opportunity. &nbsp;Endi thought that the program could be ported to the </span><span class="c3">PC</span><span>&nbsp;and distributed to the clients. &nbsp;This would eliminate both my manual entry headaches and the mailing time lag and, it would give the clients the ability run multiple alternate sorts. &nbsp;In addition, it would make possible the remaining part of my vision: automated bid submit. &nbsp;Endi and I joined forces officially forming PowerBids. &nbsp;Things moved fast. &nbsp; Endi ported the Amiga code to DOS. &nbsp;I wrote the automated bid submit interface to the Continental mainframe using an API supplied by CompuServe. &nbsp;It worked! &nbsp;Then came the Internet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Technology was a moving target. &nbsp;Continental Airlines developed their Web based crewmember support in </span><span class="c3">1997</span><span>. &nbsp; The CompuServe interface days were numbered. &nbsp; It was obvious that a </span><span class="c3">Windows</span><span>&nbsp;version of PowerBids would have to be written. &nbsp;The first Windows version was posted for download in December of 1997. &nbsp;The third and final phase of the PowerBids saga had begun. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Windows gave us the resources to make PowerBids really shine. &nbsp;Printing the bid package to see the Gantt diagrams was no longer necessary. &nbsp;They were rendered, on screen, bigger than life. &nbsp;The lines became tiles that could be easily moved in the list using either the keyboard or the mouse. &nbsp;My early 1980&rsquo;s vision had truly become reality. </span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Typical PowerBids display (with pairing detail popup shown)</span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;"><img alt="PowerBids_Screenshot.png" src="assets/PowerBids_Screenshot.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Then, in </span><span class="c3">2006</span><span>, Continental Airlines changed the process of assigning flights to pilots. &nbsp;The pilots no longer bid from a published bid packet. &nbsp;With that, PowerBids became a tool they no longer needed. &nbsp;However, PowerBids continued to service the flight attendant community. &nbsp;Finally, after over twenty-seven years of service, PowerBids Partners announced that the program would be retired after the </span><span class="c3">2015</span><span>&nbsp;December bid cycle. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Several factors contributed to this decision. &nbsp;The world moved forward and the era of the &ldquo;app&rdquo; had arrived. &nbsp;Porting PowerBids to this new paradigm would take considerable time and effort. Also, nine years after a merger between Continental Airlines and United Airlines, the scheduling processes for the two flight attendant groups were not yet consolidated. &nbsp;Not knowing which process to focus on, and the very real possibility of the airline&rsquo;s changing the bidding method for the flight attendants, as they had done with the pilots, weighed heavily in the decision.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Business Model</span></p><p class="c1"><span>First of all; to be clear: The program was developed as a tool rather than as a business. &nbsp;The scope of the client base was, from the beginning, too small to warrant any large capital expenditure on the project &nbsp;The pace of development mirrored the pace of computer technology that was rapidly becoming available to the consumer. &nbsp;That said, &nbsp;the business model was simple: Give the clients the vehicle (program) and charge them a monthly fee for the fuel (compiled data). &nbsp;PowerBids provided tremendous value. &nbsp;At its peak, and without any marketing, PowerBids grew to over a thousand active clients.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Noteworthy&hellip; Synergy between PowerBids and Continental Airlines Crew Planning</span></p><p class="c1"><span>PowerBids from the very beginning maintained a close working relationship with Crew Planning. &nbsp;It was a natural match. &nbsp;Crew Planning generated the base data and PowerBids provided the program. &nbsp;There was one interesting twist. &nbsp;PowerBids recognized from the start that giving the client bad data had the potential to cause a lot of problems. &nbsp;Because of that, PowerBids took measures to verify the integrity of each bid package downloaded from Crew Planning. &nbsp;And, from the start, errors were found. &nbsp;The pairing generating software used by the airline was far from perfect, necessitating manual changes every month. &nbsp;This inevitably introduced errors; pairings being duplicated on two or more lines, pairings missing, duplicated pairing i.d.&rsquo;s, and duplicate line i.d&rsquo;s. just to mention a few. &nbsp;PowerBids caught them all, and caught them early. &nbsp;Each month crew planning would correct the errors we reported to them thus eliminating any chance of the errors becoming operational problems for the airline or for PowerBids. &nbsp;Crew Planning was happy and the PowerBids program never crashed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Noteworthy&hellip; The DLL Solution</span></p><p class="c1"><span>With the rollout of the Windows version of PowerBids a recurring problem soon arose. &nbsp;The tech guys at the airline were busy refining their newly developed web interface. &nbsp;Because of this, the logon sequence and navigation to the bidding forms was constantly changing. &nbsp;Each change would cause the PowerBids program to return a bid submit navigation error. &nbsp;Fixing the error required writing and distributing a new version of the program. &nbsp;The clients did not like updating! &nbsp;They just wanted the program to work. &nbsp;The solution was easy. &nbsp;We moved all the navigation code into a Dynamically Linked Library (DLL). &nbsp;Then, we set up the program to check for, and automatically download, any update to the DLL before attempting to connect to the airline&rsquo;s server. &nbsp;Whenever a client would call us with a newly discovered navigation error, we would jump in, write, and upload a revised DLL. Most of the time we were able to do this within a couple of hours of the call. &nbsp;The majority of clients never knew that there had been a problem.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Behind the scenes...</span></p><p class="c1"><span>It should be noted that PowerBids had a lot of moving parts; many of which were not overtly apparent. &nbsp;The payment interface through PayPal was one. &nbsp;Others were: maintaining a web site including CGI integration programs, program documentation, source file synchronization, etc... The list goes on and on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Reminiscing on Customer Support</span></p><p class="c1"><span>At first, we would mail a floppy disk to our clients. &nbsp;Remember, there was no internet! &nbsp;Then, with the web, we posted the program for client download. &nbsp;At that time none of our clients understood the concept of installing a computer program from a download. &nbsp;Thus, we spent a lot of time doing product support. &nbsp;It was challenging yet rewarding as we watched our clients&rsquo; technical abilities improve.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Testimonials: &nbsp;Snippets from our dedicated clients&hellip;</span><hr></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>email Oct 2015: -- YOU ARE BREAKING MY HEART!!!</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Yes, I understand that you want shut Powerbids down.

From that time on, flight ops ran a lot smoother. &nbsp;Problem solved.</span></p>

In rank order, the pilots were given a shot at drawing in two weeks of leave at a time until all the leave liability was plotted. The only restriction was no more than four lines could overlap on any date. &nbsp;Simple. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>What is interesting is the &ldquo;board&rdquo; became a huge focus of attention, as pilots used it to do two, three, and even four way horse trades among themselves. The solution became self managing. &nbsp;Sweet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>As the scheduler, I attended the daily operations brief with my Squadron Commander. It was at one of those briefings that the Wing Commander was made aware of what was now a full blown manning problem affecting the sister squadrons. &nbsp;</span><span>When the Wing Commander asked my Squadron Commander if this problem would affect his squadron, he was able to state that it would not, as he had a solution in place. &nbsp;He got promoted.</span></p>

            <h2 class="c1 c2"><span>Flying Club President: &nbsp;Group problem solving </span></h2><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>In 1967, I held the position of President of the Mustang Flying Club. &nbsp;The club was a sanctioned, extracurricular, student organization of California State Polytechnic University. This is where I learned the exponential power of group problem solving. &nbsp;The &ldquo;Board of Directors&rdquo;, comprised of the club officials, would meet once a month to manage problems and set policy. &nbsp;My job as president was not to solve problems but rather to moderate the meeting. &nbsp;With that came the power to direct the conversation. </span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>The members were all bright people but we had a couple of, let&rsquo;s say, unique individuals. &nbsp;Often, when discussing a problem, they would interject ideas that, on the surface, seemed completely off topic and rather ridiculous. &nbsp;Of course this would inevitably elicit ridicule from others. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Somehow, I was successful in keeping the peace. &nbsp;Perhaps because I would make statements suggesting that the &ldquo;rogue&rdquo; ideas may somehow have merit; and, surprisingly, more often than not, they did! &nbsp;The dynamic usually played out with someone restating the idea in a slightly modified way. &nbsp;This would lead to more discussion and ultimately a good solution would be found; brainstorming comes to mind. &nbsp;However, the takeaway is this: &nbsp;Good ideas are everywhere but only found if you truly look everywhere for them; and open, unbiased discussion is the best way to do this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span>---------------</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>One problem we encountered and the solution we implemented...</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Problem: Cash flow. &nbsp;We had monthly expenses including lease payments on the fleet aircraft, insurance, maintenance, etc. &nbsp;And, we had members that were notoriously late in paying their monthly invoices. &nbsp;This made the treasurer&#39;s job a nightmare.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Solution: Stamps. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s right. &nbsp;When first presented, the idea seemed to have absolutely no merit. &nbsp;However buying stamps meant that the members had to prepay for their flying. &nbsp;Here is what happens when you change the bylaws to require all payments upfront: &nbsp;First, cash flow is reversed. &nbsp;No late payments. &nbsp;Second, revenues increase dramatically because the fleet utilization skyrockets. &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;Because once a person has paid for something fun, they simply can&rsquo;t wait to use it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Result: Our fleet doubled, our membership tripled, and our revenue quadrupled. (Also, the treasurer kept his sanity.)</span></p>

I was riding along in Business First, flying from point A to point B, trying to mind my own business. &nbsp;But, as luck would have it, I got paired with a really obnoxious seat mate. &nbsp;He was not happy and wanted everybody in the cabin to know it and to know why.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>The gist of his story was this: &nbsp;He was in the refrigeration business. &nbsp;Equipment his company had installed with a client had failed and needed to be repaired ASAP. &nbsp;Therefore, at the last minute, he had to purchase a ticket to send one of his technicians to McAllen, TX to effect the repairs. &nbsp;His beef was that he had been way overcharged for the ticket. &nbsp;His logic was that others on the same flight paid a tenth of what he had to pay for a ticket. &nbsp;He went on and on, ad nauseum.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Although he never stated who his client was, it wasn&rsquo;t difficult to deduce. &nbsp;I finally opened my mouth and the conversation went like this:</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>You&rsquo;re in the refrigeration business; correct? &nbsp;Answer: Yes. &nbsp;You obviously have a contract with [...] Foods and they have tons of processed poultry that is going to spoil if it is not being refrigerated; correct? &nbsp;Answer: Yes. &nbsp;And, you will be held liable; correct? &nbsp;Answer: Yes. &nbsp;My response: You got a bargain!</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Oh boy&hellip; He went into orbit. &nbsp;After he settled down, I proceeded to lecture him on the word &ldquo;perishable.&rdquo; &nbsp;The fact that the airline held back a small number of seats just to accommodate the likes of him came with the risk of those seats flying empty; i.e., they are a perishable item the same as an unrefrigerated dead chicken. &nbsp;And, if all the seats were marketed at a lower price, they would all be sold out. &nbsp;His only option then would have been to charter a jet at perhaps ten times what he payed for the ticket. &nbsp;Again, I reiterated that he got a bargain. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>At that point the gentleman sitting in the seat directly in front of me raised up, turned around and said: &ldquo;Looks like one of you paid attention in Econ-101, and can think!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>My seatmate shut up recoiling into his seat. &nbsp;I resumed my sudoku. </span></p>

            <h2 class="c1 c2"><span>FBO&rsquo;s Are Really Strange Ducks</span></h2><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>The business model for most Fixed Base Operators (FBO&rsquo;s) at small airports across the country is relatively simple: Make money by selling aviation fuel, supplying maintenance, and renting aircraft to pilots. &nbsp;Almost all of them use a pricing model for renting aircraft that has always astounded me. &nbsp;They charge the same hourly rate whether or not the aircraft is flown on a short local flight (three hours or less) or on an extended flight. &nbsp;They also charge a minimum fee of three flying hours for each day the aircraft is rented. </span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Example 1: If a pilot rents an aircraft for an extended period of seven days, but only flies the aircraft for eight hours, he will be charged the hourly rate for twenty-one hours. &nbsp;The cost becomes prohibitive and he drives instead.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Example 2: If a pilot wants to fly to a destination that is ten hours away and then wants to return on the third day, he will be charged at the full hourly rate for flying twenty hours. &nbsp;Again, the cost is prohibitive and he takes a commercial flight instead.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>The pilots, in these cases, want to rent the aircraft but don&rsquo;t and the FBO wants to rent them the aircraft but doesn&rsquo;t.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>What is wrong with this picture? &nbsp;The pricing model is wrong. &nbsp;The FBO is charging too much for an extended rental, whether it is for hours flown or for days rented. &nbsp;Breaking out the operational costs of rental aircraft makes it easier to see why. &nbsp;There are costs that are directly proportional to each hour of flight (variable costs). &nbsp;These are basically fuel and maintenance. &nbsp;The more the aircraft is flown, the more the cost. &nbsp;Then there are the costs that are only a function of monthly billing. &nbsp;These are mostly payments to a bank and an insurance company. &nbsp;No matter how much an aircraft flies, these costs are the same. &nbsp;Call this overhead. &nbsp;Obviously the price of rental has to be set higher than the variable cost, otherwise the FBO will have to spend more than he takes in with losses directly proportional to hours flown. &nbsp;The amount (margin) that the rental price is set above the variable costs directly contributes to paying off the overhead. &nbsp;If the aircraft flies enough hours in a month, then the bank and insurance company will get their check. &nbsp;If it flies more than enough then the FBO will make a profit. </span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>This takes us back to the big picture. &nbsp;What should the pricing model be for extended rentals? &nbsp;First, charge incrementally for the variable costs. &nbsp;The more hours flown, the more the charge. &nbsp;This protects the FBO from losses. &nbsp;Second, charge a margin rate per day for extended rentals. &nbsp;If the average utilization rate on the aircraft is three hours a day and the margin is $50 per hour then the charge would be $150 per day. &nbsp;No matter how long the client is gone with the aircraft and no matter how many hours client flies the aircraft, the FBO is protected. &nbsp;He nets the same margin whether or not the aircraft is on an extended rental. &nbsp;Actually, his business should improve because extended rentals are now affordable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Everybody wins!</span></p>

Did you notice? If you didn&rsquo;t, you should have! &nbsp;In my humble opinion, we witnessed the </span><span class="c6"><a target="_blank" class="c0" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity">singularity</a></span><span>&nbsp;of space travel. &nbsp;Elon Musk and the gang at SpaceX did something truly remarkable. &nbsp;They recovered a rocket booster after it was shot into space. &nbsp;Big deal&hellip; right? &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Right!</span><span>&nbsp; They didn&rsquo;t just fish it out of the ocean. Nooooo, they flew it back to Cape Canaveral and landed it vertically, on a pad, dead center. &nbsp;That is to say, they stuck the landing. &nbsp;</span><span class="c6"><a target="_blank" class="c0" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANv5UfZsvZQ">Here&rsquo;s a youTube link to the event</a></span><span>. &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">These guys are on fire!</span><span>&nbsp;(No pun intended.) &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span></span></p><p class="c5"><span>By the way, when I say fly I mean fly. &nbsp;The booster, lets call it the vehicle, is equipped with an arrangement of grid fins that literally steer it while it is plummeting back to earth. It has landing gear that is extended a couple of seconds before touchdown. And, it executes a zero-zero landing. </span></p><p class="c2"><span></span></p><p class="c5"><span>What do I mean zero-zero? You see the minimum thrust generated by the vehicle, thrust used to stop its descent when it reaches the landing pad, is far in excess of the weight of the vehicle; i.e. the vehicle can&rsquo;t hover! &nbsp;During the last ten seconds, or so, of flight the vehicle slows from over 200 knots to zero knots timing it so that </span><span class="c1">zero</span><span>&nbsp;velocity is reached right at </span><span class="c1">zero</span><span>&nbsp;altitude. Then, the rocket motor is cut off. &nbsp;Buy the way, the timing is critical. Cut it off too late and the vehicle will have started to takeoff again resulting in a catastrophic fall back to earth. &nbsp;Musk, with a great sense of humor, calls this maneuver a </span><span class="c1">hover slam</span><span>. Truly remarkable.</span></p><p class="c2"><span></span></p><p class="c5"><span>All of this begs the question: why the singularity? &nbsp;Simple, the cost of space travel suddenly got affordable. &nbsp;Poke around. You will find excitement everywhere. &nbsp;There even are plans to mine asteroids. There&#39;s Big money in mining asteroids. &nbsp;My guess is it&rsquo;s bigger than Big Oil! &nbsp;If that doesn&rsquo;t get your attention, it should. &nbsp;Is there an echo in here? &nbsp;The race is on and I love races. &nbsp;Count me in. &nbsp;Deddens</span></p>

        <p>This section contains summaries of several of my projects from <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive" target='_blank'><img src="assets/GA.png"> General Assembly's Web Development Immersive</a> course that I just finished. Except for <em>Building This Page</em>, they are arranged in the order they were created starting with a simple tic-tac-toe game then progressing on to fully functioning Riby and NodeJS web applications. The projects were typically week long group efforts.  Each summary describes the project’s objective, implementation dialog, a link to the final result, and a link to the the source code published on my GitHub page.</p>

            <p>For now this is just filler text.  The real text is being developed using Google Docs (Docs). Once the document is completed, I will use the Docs "Download As" feature to generate the html. From there it is a simple task to extract the &ltbody&gt section and drop it in here. The only caveat is the styling. Inserting more than one Google document creates class selector naming conflicts. The &ltstyle&gt is extracted from the &lthead&gt section and placed into this page's style sheet. Docs likes to use c1, c2, etc as class selector names. The problem is each one is unique to the current document.  The workaround is to encapsulate the html in a new class or id selector then convert, for example, the c1 reference in the style sheet to a decedent selector of the new selector, e.g. "#new c1". This is how I generated html the content for the vignettes and how I handled the styling.</p>

            <p>This was the first project the students tackled. It was a solo endeavor. The object was to use the HTML and JavaScript skills learned during the early weeks of class to develop an app. The <a href="https://github.com/sdeddens/tic-tac-toe#readme" target="_blank">README</a> markdown file on GitHub covers the goals, technologies used, and the approach taken to achieve the projects goals. The list of technologies used is rather amazing. They formed the foundation for every project that followed. </p>
