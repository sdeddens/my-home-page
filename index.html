<h4>Introduction</h4>
Hi.  I’m Steve Deddens; almost everyone refers to me simply as “Deddens.”  This page, that I built, serves as a vehicle to introduce myself and allow you to get to know more about me.  There are two sections:  “My Projects” and “The Vignettes.”  If you are looking for a summary of my professional career, please visit my <a class="aLinkedIn" href="js_injection" target='_blank'>LinkedIn page</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
But first... I want to interrupt and share a couple of human interest images:
      </p>

      <a href="#" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#modal-future-1"><img src="" width="40" class='pull-left img-rounded future-1' alt='Our Future' title="View Image"></a>

      <a href="#" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#modal-future-2"><img src="" width="40" class='pull-left img-rounded future-2' alt='Our Future' title="View Image"></a>

These two images show me interacting with a group of two-year-old boys whom I supervise on Sunday mornings while their parents are attending church services.  They are working a jigsaw puzzle on my handheld device.  What great fun it is working with these children that <em>are our future</em>. Notice the intense focus of attention these boys have! That's what makes these images so great.

      </p>

      <p>
The My Projects section has links to several of my projects from Web Development Immersive course that I just finished. The projects were typically week long group efforts.  Each link describes the project’s objective, implementation dialog, a link to the final result, and a link to the the source code published on my GitHub page.
      </p>

      <p>
The Vignette Section has links to a series of short essays derived from my various experiences. Some are rather humorous!  The central themes are: working with people, problem solving, and hard work.  My favorite is “My Vision: PowerBids.  It may be <abbr title="Too Long Didn't Read">TLDR</abbr> but the testimonials alone, at the end, make it well worth the read.  I invite you to explore all the vignettes!

<h4>Vignettes</h4>
Following is a list several small “vignettes” written by me.  They are designed to showcase some of the small triumphs I have had over my life history.  This is my opportunity to give the reader a view into my persona.  The overall theme is problem solving.  I am proud to share them.  Deddens

            <h4>How Things Work</h4>
            <p>
I have always been fascinated with the way things work.  If I weren’t building something, then I was taking something apart just to see how it was made.  From automobile transmissions to microprocessors, I simply had to know how they functioned.
            </p>
            <p>
Seems to me most people learn inductively.  Not me.  No, I have to learn the hard way.  I have to “take it apart”, see inside.  I learn deductively.  As it turns out, it pays dividends to learn that way.  As they say, a picture is worth a thousand words.  Once one “sees inside” a thing, it is easy to comprehend and remember the total scope of a thing’s functionality.  Through deduction, the permutations become obvious.  At that point, an instructor simply provides guidance.
            </p>
            <p>
A close friend of mine once gave me a huge compliment that went something like this: “We’re hungry, get out the battering ram, and knock the front door down only to find you inside at the dinner table half done with supper.”  Understanding how and why things work is my strength.  It’s my key to the back door.

<h2 class="c1"><span>My Vision: PowerBids</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Synopsis</span></p><p class="c1"><span>This document serves to explain what PowerBids was, how it came into existence, and to give insight into its design and structure. -- Written by Steve Deddens, December 2015</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Narrative -- How a vision became reality. </span></p><p class="c1"><span>Each and every month, as a pilot for Continental Airlines, I would face the complicated and time consuming task of bidding for my next month&rsquo;s flying schedule. &nbsp;Before I built PowerBids, I did this by hand using the company supplied bid package. (a pool of available schedules published monthly for bid)</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>The flying schedules in a bid package are commonly referred to as &ldquo;lines of time.&rdquo; &nbsp;The lines are formatted horizontally as thirty-one day calendars across the page with twelve schedules/lines printed per page; each line has a unique numeric reference and the body of each line contains alphanumeric references to &ldquo;pairings&rdquo;, printed elsewhere. &nbsp;The pairings contain the detailed specifics of each day&rsquo;s flying.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>The bidding process involves analyzing and sorting the lines into a list ordered according to one&rsquo;s preferences; then, typing the list into a computer terminal. &nbsp;After the bid closes, the schedules are awarded in seniority order. &nbsp;The most senior person bidding need only bid one line. &nbsp;The most junior person bidding will get the last line remaining. &nbsp;The bid packages are printed front and back using a monospaced font, can easily exceed 400 lines, and can be over a half inch thick. &nbsp;Deciding which lines to bid, and in what order, quickly becomes a monumental task.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Faced with this difficult and repetitive task, I had devised a manual process to help me bid. &nbsp;First, I used a simple algorithm to calculate a line&rsquo;s productivity (paid time relative to unpaid time spent away from home). &nbsp;Then, I would literally cut out the printed lines and rearrange them in productivity order. &nbsp;In essence, I was reformatting the bid package according to my requirements. </span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>A vision haunted me for years as I toiled away at this process. &nbsp;I imagined building a computer program that would automate what I was doing manually, then submit the bid to the company&rsquo;s mainframe computer. &nbsp;I also imagined enhancing the alphanumeric pairing references on the lines with much more intuitive and informative Gantt diagrams. &nbsp;Problem was, my vision required: a personal computer, programming software, being able to access the company&#39;s files containing the bid package data, and a network connection to the airline&rsquo;s computers. &nbsp;All of which, in the 1970&rsquo;s, and most of the 1980&rsquo;s, did not exist. &nbsp;In addition, I would need to learn computer programming.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>However, things started to change and in </span><span class="c3">1987</span><span>, the airline started posting the files I needed on CompuServe&rsquo;s new dial-up network. &nbsp;Suddenly, my vision was within reach. &nbsp;I purchased an </span><span class="c3">Amiga</span><span>&nbsp;computer, a text editor, and a Modula-2 compiler (programming software). &nbsp;Then, I rolled up my sleeves, taught myself the Modula-2 programming language, and went to work writing a parser to use on the newly available files. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Surprisingly, it took me only a couple of days to write a program that would read the files, calculate all the lines&rsquo; productivity values, and print the bid package in productivity order. &nbsp;Wow! &nbsp;Just like that, I had a valuable tool that automated the sorting I was doing by hand.. &nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t stop there. &nbsp;All the pieces were in place to realize a second part of my vision. &nbsp;In a couple of days of programming I was printing the lines using Gantt diagrams to graphically illustrate the pairings. &nbsp;Except for automatically submitting the bid, my vision was realized. &nbsp;Also, It should be noted that I leaned on Steve Endicott (Endi), one of my college roommates and an accomplished computer programmer, for tutoring and advice. &nbsp;He was the go-to resource whenever I hit the wall trying to solve a problem. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I showed a printout of my work to a copilot. &nbsp;He immediately pulled a hundred dollar bill from his wallet and proclaimed that he was my first client. &nbsp;Client? &nbsp;Up until that moment there was never any thought of marketing my work. Within a few months I had over a hundred new clients handing me entry forms containing their specific bidding parameters, and paying me for a printout. &nbsp;I bought a small database program for the Amiga. &nbsp;Each month I manually transcribed the data from the forms into the database. &nbsp;Then, using my software and the Gantt diagrams, I would print and mail a custom bid package to each client. &nbsp;Consider this as a stepping stone in a long journey as the monetary return was never really enough to justify the labor involved. &nbsp;My bidding problem was solved and I was also able to help my peers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>By </span><span class="c3">1994</span><span>&nbsp;the personal computer was becoming ubiquitous; presenting yet another opportunity. &nbsp;Endi thought that the program could be ported to the </span><span class="c3">PC</span><span>&nbsp;and distributed to the clients. &nbsp;This would eliminate both my manual entry headaches and the mailing time lag and, it would give the clients the ability run multiple alternate sorts. &nbsp;In addition, it would make possible the remaining part of my vision: automated bid submit. &nbsp;Endi and I joined forces officially forming PowerBids. &nbsp;Things moved fast. &nbsp; Endi ported the Amiga code to DOS. &nbsp;I wrote the automated bid submit interface to the Continental mainframe using an API supplied by CompuServe. &nbsp;It worked! &nbsp;Then came the Internet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Technology was a moving target. &nbsp;Continental Airlines developed their Web based crewmember support in </span><span class="c3">1997</span><span>. &nbsp; The CompuServe interface days were numbered. &nbsp; It was obvious that a </span><span class="c3">Windows</span><span>&nbsp;version of PowerBids would have to be written. &nbsp;The first Windows version was posted for download in December of 1997. &nbsp;The third and final phase of the PowerBids saga had begun. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Windows gave us the resources to make PowerBids really shine. &nbsp;Printing the bid package to see the Gantt diagrams was no longer necessary. &nbsp;They were rendered, on screen, bigger than life. &nbsp;The lines became tiles that could be easily moved in the list using either the keyboard or the mouse. &nbsp;My early 1980&rsquo;s vision had truly become reality. </span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Typical PowerBids display (with pairing detail popup shown)</span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;"><img alt="PowerBids_Screenshot.png" src="assets/PowerBids_Screenshot.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Then, in </span><span class="c3">2006</span><span>, Continental Airlines changed the process of assigning flights to pilots. &nbsp;The pilots no longer bid from a published bid packet. &nbsp;With that, PowerBids became a tool they no longer needed. &nbsp;However, PowerBids continued to service the flight attendant community. &nbsp;Finally, after over twenty-seven years of service, PowerBids Partners announced that the program would be retired after the </span><span class="c3">2015</span><span>&nbsp;December bid cycle. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Several factors contributed to this decision. &nbsp;The world moved forward and the era of the &ldquo;app&rdquo; had arrived. &nbsp;Porting PowerBids to this new paradigm would take considerable time and effort. Also, nine years after a merger between Continental Airlines and United Airlines, the scheduling processes for the two flight attendant groups were not yet consolidated. &nbsp;Not knowing which process to focus on, and the very real possibility of the airline&rsquo;s changing the bidding method for the flight attendants, as they had done with the pilots, weighed heavily in the decision.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Business Model</span></p><p class="c1"><span>First of all; to be clear: The program was developed as a tool rather than as a business. &nbsp;The scope of the client base was, from the beginning, too small to warrant any large capital expenditure on the project &nbsp;The pace of development mirrored the pace of computer technology that was rapidly becoming available to the consumer. &nbsp;That said, &nbsp;the business model was simple: Give the clients the vehicle (program) and charge them a monthly fee for the fuel (compiled data). &nbsp;PowerBids provided tremendous value. &nbsp;At its peak, and without any marketing, PowerBids grew to over a thousand active clients.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Noteworthy&hellip; Synergy between PowerBids and Continental Airlines Crew Planning</span></p><p class="c1"><span>PowerBids from the very beginning maintained a close working relationship with Crew Planning. &nbsp;It was a natural match. &nbsp;Crew Planning generated the base data and PowerBids provided the program. &nbsp;There was one interesting twist. &nbsp;PowerBids recognized from the start that giving the client bad data had the potential to cause a lot of problems. &nbsp;Because of that, PowerBids took measures to verify the integrity of each bid package downloaded from Crew Planning. &nbsp;And, from the start, errors were found. &nbsp;The pairing generating software used by the airline was far from perfect, necessitating manual changes every month. &nbsp;This inevitably introduced errors; pairings being duplicated on two or more lines, pairings missing, duplicated pairing i.d.&rsquo;s, and duplicate line i.d&rsquo;s. just to mention a few. &nbsp;PowerBids caught them all, and caught them early. &nbsp;Each month crew planning would correct the errors we reported to them thus eliminating any chance of the errors becoming operational problems for the airline or for PowerBids. &nbsp;Crew Planning was happy and the PowerBids program never crashed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Noteworthy&hellip; The DLL Solution</span></p><p class="c1"><span>With the rollout of the Windows version of PowerBids a recurring problem soon arose. &nbsp;The tech guys at the airline were busy refining their newly developed web interface. &nbsp;Because of this, the logon sequence and navigation to the bidding forms was constantly changing. &nbsp;Each change would cause the PowerBids program to return a bid submit navigation error. &nbsp;Fixing the error required writing and distributing a new version of the program. &nbsp;The clients did not like updating! &nbsp;They just wanted the program to work. &nbsp;The solution was easy. &nbsp;We moved all the navigation code into a Dynamically Linked Library (DLL). &nbsp;Then, we set up the program to check for, and automatically download, any update to the DLL before attempting to connect to the airline&rsquo;s server. &nbsp;Whenever a client would call us with a newly discovered navigation error, we would jump in, write, and upload a revised DLL. Most of the time we were able to do this within a couple of hours of the call. &nbsp;The majority of clients never knew that there had been a problem.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Behind the scenes...</span></p><p class="c1"><span>It should be noted that PowerBids had a lot of moving parts; many of which were not overtly apparent. &nbsp;The payment interface through PayPal was one. &nbsp;Others were: maintaining a web site including CGI integration programs, program documentation, source file synchronization, etc... The list goes on and on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Reminiscing on Customer Support</span></p><p class="c1"><span>At first, we would mail a floppy disk to our clients. &nbsp;Remember, there was no internet! &nbsp;Then, with the web, we posted the program for client download. &nbsp;At that time none of our clients understood the concept of installing a computer program from a download. &nbsp;Thus, we spent a lot of time doing product support. &nbsp;It was challenging yet rewarding as we watched our clients&rsquo; technical abilities improve.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Testimonials: &nbsp;Snippets from our dedicated clients&hellip;</span><hr></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>email Oct 2015: -- YOU ARE BREAKING MY HEART!!!</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Yes, I understand that you want shut Powerbids down.

            <h4>Manpower Planning: When I was an airline pilot.</h4>
            <p>
In early 1988, flying as an MD-80 captain for Continental Airlines, I became involved in the monthly process of compiling the planning documents from which the pilots would bid for their monthly flying schedules.
            </p>
            <p>
Immediately I spotted an error in the staffing formula that had the potential to become a big problem.
            </p>
            <p>
The company was underestimating the number of pilots required to properly staff the scheduled monthly flying.  I tried to explain the problem to the Vice President of Flight Operations.  For some reason he simply did not grasp it.  Finally, in exasperation, I stated that the problem was going to come into extreme focus on Easter Sunday.  I predicted that operations would melt down with chaos to follow.  He politely dismissed me from his office and I went back to work.
            </p>
            <p>
Sure enough… Easter came and unfortunately, the airline’s operations melted down just as I had predicted.  The cost went way beyond dollars and cents.  The disruption in passenger travel plans and the loss of goodwill was incalculable, not to mention the ensuing investigation by Congress.
            </p>
            <p>
A week later, and much to the V.P.’s credit, I received a call from him asking if he could come and meet me to discuss the melt down.  We met and rehashed why I thought the staffing was incorrect.  We also discussed what should be done to remedy the situation.
            </p>
            <p>
He implemented all of my recommendations. From that time on, flight ops ran a lot smoother.  Problem solved.
